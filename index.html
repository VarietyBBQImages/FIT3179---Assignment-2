              The above map shows the total number of
              <b>living languages</b> used as first languages within countries,
              and the language
              <b>diversity index</b>
              of each country. The diversity index is defined as the probability
              of any two randomly selected people within a country to speak
              different first languages. Land-locked countries and densely
              packed island nations tend to have higher language counts and
              diversity indices. This is because these places allow for ease of
              travel between nations and therefore promote mixture between
              cultures. Whereas isolated island nations such as Iceland and
              Japan have low diversity indices as historically travel to these
              nations would have been much harder. <br />The bubble chart on the
              left displays the <b>established</b> vs.
              <b>immigrant</b> languages in countries around the world. The
              chart is interactive so you can zoom to view smaller nations.
              Established languages are languages which have existed in the
              country for the country's known history. Immigrant languages are
              languages which were brought to the nation through movement of
              people from other parts of the world. Modern western countries
              have high numbers of immigrant languages as higher standards of
              living attract people from around the world.<br /><br />

              <b>highly spoken</b> languages around the world. The bar chart
              shows total number of speakers and the number of countries which
              speak the language. For someone looking to learn a language they
              may want to take into account how many places they could speak
              that language, not just how many people speak it around the world.
              It's also clear how colonisation has had an effect on the number
              of places a language is spoken.<br />The tree map shows the
              proportion of people by percentage of speakers worldwide which
              speak the most popular languages around the world, hover to see
              which languages is which.<br /><br
